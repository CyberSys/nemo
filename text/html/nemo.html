<H2>This document is under construction</H2>

This document describes NEMO, and how you can get it from anonymous ftp.
To install it, 
<A HREF="ftp://saturn.astro.umd.edu/pub/nemo/nemo.ps.Z"> read </A>
the manual and $NEMO/README file <P>

The anonymous ftp server at astro.umd.edu can get you the following:

<H1>Introduction </H1>
<I>NEMO</I> is a <I>Stellar Dynamics Toolbox</I> for users as well
as programmers in program development. It has various
programs to create, integrate and analyze N-body systems. In addition
there are various tools to operate images, tables and orbits,
including FITS files to export/import to/from other astronomical
data reduction packages. <P>

A good start is the manual page <I>programs(8NEMO)</I>, which lists
programs thematically, and <I>index(1NEMO)</I>, which lists them 
alphabetically.<P>

<B>NEMO</B> is very much integrated into the Unix operating system,
so users are expected to use standard Unix or Local commands as glue
between the various tasks (cat, ls, rm, cp, awk, mongo, sm, \fIetc.\fP)

<H2> Getting Started </H2>
What you need to do to set yourself up for <B>NEMO</B>:<P>

The easiest way is to add the following two lines to your \fI.cshrc\fP 
file AFTER the command search path (\fBPATH\fP environment
variable or \fBpath\fP shell variable in the \fIcsh\fP shell) has been set:
<PRE>
        ...
        set path = ( ... )
        ...
        setenv NEMO /saturn/nemo
        if(-e $NEMO/nemo.rc) source $NEMO/nemo.rc
</PRE>

If you need more control over your environment, there are other methods
described elsewhere (The <I>NEMO Users/Programmers Guide</I>, Appendix A).

<H2> How To Run Nemo Programs </H2>
NEMO programs can be run just as any other command in Unix, in that sense
NEMO is nothing more than an extension of Unix.<P>

NEMO programs all work by using a series of <I>keyword=value</I> pairs
on the commandline.
If the order of the supplied keywords is the same as the
program expects them, the <I>keyword=</I> part can be omitted, simply to save
keystrokes.  There is a consistent ordering of keywords in most programs
that allows experienced users to use such (and other) shortcuts.
(e.g. <B>in=</B> the first one, <B>out=</B> the second one etc.). <P>

NEMO programs make a distinction between
program keywords (keywords unique to a program) and system keywords (a
fixed set of keywords that each NEMO program understands).  The system
keywords that you are likely to
use are <I> help=</I> and <I>yapp=</I>, and to a lesser degree 
<I>debug=</I> and <I>error=</I>.  The <I>help=</I> gives various types of 
inline aid from a program. There is also online help on a 
program, for which unix <I>man(1)</I> command (or any of it's derived friends)
is normally used. The <I>yapp=</I> sets the graphics device used by
programs who use a graphics device. You system manager may have given
you a default.<P>

Each system keyword can be defaulted by setting it's equivalent
environment variable (in upper case though). <P>

Examples: Consider the program <I>mkplummer</I>, a program which creates
an N-body realization of a Plummer sphere:
To get online help, one types:
<P>
        man mkplummer
<P>
and to get various types of inline help:
<PRE>
        mkplummer help=
        mkplummer help=h
        mkplummer help='?'
</PRE>
Note the literal quotes around the question-mark needed if you use
a regular Unix shell as interface.
The first <I>help=</I> reminds you of the order of the
program keywords and their default values. The second form, <I>help=h</I>
prints out a small one-line reminder what each keyword means. The last
form <I>help='?'</I> lists various options the user interface understands,
this one is not program dependant.
