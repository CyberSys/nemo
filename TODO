for 3.2.0
  - make sure cfitsio stuff is ok in configure
  - the change in get_atable() should mean routines need to work
    on buffered table read better
  - ccdmath WCS is broken

  - fix installation if no fortran is available
	(fmath in potential not needed)
	(some potential/data not needed)
  - intel linker problems (use different technique to force loading?)
  - allow a pgplot internal install without running configure twice
  - get a mini-NEMO going 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

some other help on configure:
	http://www.airs.com/ian/configure/

- io_nemo library written by JCL in Marseille

- add the self-exploding problem for treecodes (Salmon ...)
  into NEMODAT

- clean code so it can write > 2GB datafiles
  Testing can be done with:
	mkspiral s000 1000000 nmodel=40
  which creates a file just over the famous 2GB limits
  testing reading
	tsf s000

- install on solaris is broken:

	- FORLIBS needs the 
	  -R /opt/SUNWspro/lib -L/opt/SUNWspro/lib -lF77 -lM77 -lV77 -lsunmath 
	  type solution for pgplot, and if so,
	- FORLIBS need to be added to YAPPLIB

	- sun's make doesn't work, it need gmake

- compile under cygwin

- fix for pgplot  when libpng is needed, or tcl/tk for that matter....

- fix for gcc3 where the libraries have changed. It's now a lot easier:
	/opt/gcc/3.2.1/lib
  vs.
	/opt/gcc/2.95.3/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.95.3/

- if the code has to be C++ friendly, i.e. the nemo_main() be compiled
  by c++, but the rest with CC,  all extern's must be wrapped in


  #if defined(__cplusplus)
  extern "C" {
  #endif
  ...
  #if defined(__cplusplus)
  }
  #endif

- getparam:  an option to produce an iraf .par file?


- many integrators use conflicting designations for tstop,freq,freqout


- getparam:  finish the outkeys= stuff
