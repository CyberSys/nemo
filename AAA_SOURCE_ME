#
# Source this file to install and build NEMO from scratch with 'manybody'
#
# In order to get a distribution to get a easy PGPLOT enabled version do e.g.
#	cvs co nemo
#	cd nemo; mkdir local; cd local; cvs co pgplot
#       source AAA_SOURCE_ME
#
# to clean up the cloest approach is:
#	make distclean          # cleans most of the things created
#	omen                    # remove NEMO* and YAPP* things, cleans the path
#
#
# See also approach in other 'manybody' modules, e.g. starlab, partiview
#
# Within NEMO there are a few other scripts which have been used to automate
# installations:
#    src/scripts/quickps
#    src/scripts/bootstrap
#    src/scripts/test_a_new_nemo_cvs
#
# for other approaches we used to have.

# 25-jul-01  Peter Teuben       created, for MANYBODY
# 18-jan-02  PJT                added optional PGPLOT if detected
#  3-dec-02  PJT                added vogl stuff
#  1-mar-03  PJT                added make_html 
# 17-jun-03  PJT                better path, rehash for immediate use
