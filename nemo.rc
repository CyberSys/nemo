# This file is to be sourced to add NEMO to your environment
#
# Normally sourcing this file (in csh) will only be allowed
# once, because an assumed alias 'nemo' does it. If this is done
# successfully, the alias 'nemo' is overwritten with another one
#
# This script relies upon the fact that the environment variable NEMO
# exists, but NEMOBIN does not yet (as it is set through the NEMORC script).
# If NEMOBIN does exist, it is considered an error, and aborted
# Hence 'unsetenv NEMOBIN' is the only way for re-entry.
