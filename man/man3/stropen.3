.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIstropen()\fP opens a file by filename and associates a stream
with it, much like \fIfopen(3)\fP does. It has a few additional
features:
.PP
(1) existing files cannot be opened for writing unless 
\fBmode=w!\fP (\fBmode=a!\fP is also permitted),
.PP
(2) names of form \fB-\fP map to \fIstdin/stdout\fP, depending on mode,
.PP
(3) names of the form \fB-num\fP for some small num set up a
stream to read/write file descriptor \fBnum\fP.
.PP
(4) With \fBmode=s\fP a file is opened in write-scratch mode. Whenever
\fIstrclose\fP is called, the file is also deleted. When the \fBfilename\fP
does not start with a "/", a unique temporary filename is automatically
created.
.PP
(5) Output file with the name "\fB.\fP" (dot) are equivalent to
a bit sink (\fB/dev/null\fP).
.PP
Note that \fIfopen(3)\fP itself officially recognizes the following 
modes:\fBr, w, a, r+, w+, a+\fP.
.PP
\fIstrclose()\fP closes a stream, which is the recommended practice 
within NEMO (formally, an exit from the program using
\fIexit(3)\fP also closes all open files properly).
Each opened stream uses additional space in internal tables that are
free'd when \fIstrclose\fP is called. 
.PP
\fIstrdelete()\fP deletes the file associated with the stream \fBstr\fP 
previously opened with \fIstropen\fP. 
If \fBscratch\fP is set TRUE it will always delete the file, if set to 
FALSE the file must have been opened in scratch mode to be deleted.
This routine also clears the internal filetable, that was used 
when \fIstropen\fP was called.
.PP
\fIstrname()\fP returns the name of the file that had been opened by
\fIstropen\fP. Note it returns a pointer to an internal static table, and
should not be overwritten. See also \fIscopy(3NEMO)\fP.
.PP
\fIstrseek\fP returns seekability of a stream. This is primarely useful
for \fIfilestruct\fP, which might need to know if stream i/o
can be optimized with deferred input.
