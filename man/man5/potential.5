.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIpotential\fP is a convenient data structure to hold an
ascii description of a user selected potential, and all it's
desriptors (id-name, parameters, associated file(s)). It
is currently also stored in the \fIorbit(5NEMO)\fP data
structure.
.PP
\fIpotential(5NEMO)\fP  is a 'filestructure' which 
defines a potential (and force field) through a standardized
interface routine, as described in \fIpotential(3NEMO)\fP.
.PP
A \fIpotential(5NEMO)\fP datafile \fBmust\fP
have two externally accessible entry points
\fBinipotential\fP and \fBpotential\fP, with a 
parameter sequence as described above. The parameters are all
called by reference to allow interfaces with some common
but more primitive languages. Notably FORTRAN is now
supported in the BSD calling convention of parameters
(see \fBpotentialf.c\fP).
The first parameter, \fBpar[0]\fP in C, and \fBpar(1)\fP in
fortran, is reserved for the pattern speed. User written potentials
must take this into account. And return the pattern speed (or it's
default) in that location. If another parameter describes the
pattern speed (e.g. the lagrangian radius, as in \fIathan92\fP), 
\fIinipotential\fP 
must compute the pattern speed and return it in the first parameter.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following table lists the non-pattern speed parameters 
for a few example potentials
found in \fB$NEMOOBJ/potential\fP. \fINote: the pattern
speed is not listed here\fP

A full listing, including their mathematical expression can be
found in the NEMO manual, see also \fI$NEMO/text/manuals/potential.inc,\fP,
and of course in \fI$NEMO/src/orbit/potential/data\fP.
.SH BUGS
Since the later introduction of a third character valued
parameter in \fIinipotential()\fP
a Fortran-to-C interface cannot be used in as portable a way as
before. A small Fortran-to-C interface is however available, but
is not guaranteed to work on all machines.
Also keep in mind if you write your potentials in fortran:
common blocks and other used routines get loaded into the
executable, with the potential for duplicate symbol names.

Most likely \fIloadobj(3NEMO)\fP will break under such circumstances.
.PP
Second: no I/O should be done. In practise this also means that
this third parameter, \fBpotfile\fP, of \fIinipotential\fP cannot
be used, as is mostly serves as a filename. The reason is that
we didn't want the programs to have to link in huge fortran I/O
libraries, including various portability problems. 
.PP
There is one exception: \fIpotlist(1NEMO)\fP is allowed to 
load \fIpotential(5NEMO)\fP files with FORTRAN WRITE statements.
After you have made sure the function works as you think, 
these statements must be Commented out and can then be reloaded
by most other potential/orbit programs.
.SH FLOW POTENTIALS
Experimental changes to the interface were implemented by the
\fIflowcode(1NEMO)\fP and \fIvpotcode(1NEMO)\fP code. This
requires special versions of potential desriptors, with the
same calling convention but different meaning to the arguments:
.PP
\fBflowcode\fP uses a potential which returns the (currently 2-dimensional)
velocities at the requested input position. These are returned in the
\fBacc\fP slot. The \fBpot\fP has no meaning. 
.PP
\fBvpotcode\fP uses a potential which expects the velocity to be 
input in the \fBacc\fP slot, but the returned arguments
(\fBacc\fP and \fBpot\fP) have the same meaning. This is to emulate
(non-coriolis) forces which depend on velocity.
.SH "MERIDIONAL PLANE IN AXISYMMETRIC POTENTIALS"
A well known fact about meridional motion in an axisymmetric system
is that their 3D motion is really a 2D motion in the R-z plane with
an effective potential

                      L**2
            Phi +    ------
                     2 * R**2
.fi
but unlike motion in rotating potential this requires the authors of
potentials to modify their code in something like the following:
(pos[0] is R, pos[1] is z, pos[2] is not used)
.nf
    double tmp = sqr(ang_mom/pos[0]);
    *pot += 0.5*tmp;
    acc[0] += tmp / pos[0];
