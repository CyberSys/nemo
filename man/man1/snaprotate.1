.TH SNAPROTATE 1NEMO "21 November 1998"
.SH NAME
snaprotate \- rotate N-body snapshot file about principle axes.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnaprotate in=\fPsnap-file \fBout=\fPsnap-file [parameter=value] .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsnaprotate\fP rotates the positions and velocities of an
N-body snapshot file. A maximum of 3 rotations around either the x, y or
z axes can be applied in any order. An Eulerian rotation
is a rotation around the z, y and z axes respectively.
.PP
The rotation is counter clock-wise (i.e., mathematically positive, unless 
\fBinvert=f\fP is used) as seen from the right-handed \fIxyz\fP-axes;
a \fBz\fP rotation will rotate the \fBx\fP axis towards the \fBy\fP axis;
a \fBy\fP rotation will rotate the \fBz\fP axis towards the \fBx\fP axis;
a \fBx\fP rotation will rotate the \fBy\fP axis towards the \fBz\fP axis.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized; they may be given in any order.
.TP 24
\fBin=\fP\fIsnap-file\fP
Input data is read from \fIsnap-file\fP, which must be in snapshot format.
.TP
\fBout=\fP\fIsnap-file\fP
Output data is written to \fIsnap-file\fP.
.TP
\fBtheta=\fP\fIx-angle\fP
Angles (in degrees) to rotate particles about the specified axes in the
\fBorder=\fP keyword. Up to 3 rotations can be applied. 
Default: none.
.TP
\fBorder=\fP\fItrans-order\fP
Order to apply the rotations about the three coordinate axes.
An Eulerian rotation would be \fBorder=zyz\fP. Default is none.
.TP
\fBinvert=\fP\fIinvert-flag\fP
If \fBtrue\fP, invert specified transformation.
Useful for rotating something back to original coordinate system.
Default is \fBfalse\fP.
.TP
\fBtscale=\fP\fIt-scale-factor\fP
If used, this is the degrees per time-unit that the \fBtheta\fP angles
are multiplied with in order to calculate the actual rotation angle.
This can give interesting effects if used for simulations.
Default not used.
.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you have a barred galaxy model, \fIbar.dat\fP, 
with the galactic plane at z=0
and the bar along the y axis (position angle=0), 
and want to project this (such that z=0 will be the sky plane,
and the positive z-axis pointed towards the observer) with given final 
position angle ($pa), inclination ($inc) and angle from line of nodes
to bar ($phi) the following rotations will do the job:
.nf
    set pa=39
    set inc=-45
    set phi=-34
    snaprotate bar.dat n7476.dat "atand(tand($phi)/cosd($inc)),$inc,$pa" zyz
    snapplot n7476 psize="z>0?0.03:0.0"
.fi
where \fBpsize\fP was choosen such that ``near'' (z>0) 
particles were plotted a bit bigger to accentuate
the near side of the model. Flipping the sign if $inc will flip the near
and far side.
