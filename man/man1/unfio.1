.TH UNFIO 1NEMO "19 March 1999"
.SH NAME
unfio \- access fortran unformatted I/O files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBunfio\fP \fBin=\fP\fIinput_file\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBunfio\fP scans (and optionally dumps) a binary file, created with a 
FORTRAN program with the \fIform='unformatted'\fP OPEN statement.
.PP
It is currently only implemented for BSD-type fortran compilers with
arbitrary endianism of the bytes (i.e. probably excluding 
VMS and Cray compilers).
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
input file. No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
output file. Fortran headers and trailers have been stripped off.
Default: no output.
.TP
\fBblock=\fP
which block to display (0=all, default: scan). By default it will scan
the file and report the blocksize.
.TP
\fBtype=\fP
Format (valid are: {int, float, double}) of the data-item. This
assumes all data in a block has the same type.
.TP
\fBselect=\fP
Which items to select in a block. The default is all. Any 
\fInemoinp(3NEMO)\fP  expression can be given.
Default: all.
.TP
\fBformat=\fP
The \fIprintf(3)\fP format to use when displaying a block display [%d,%g].
.TP
\fBcount=t|f\fP
A logical denoting if to display an element counter too?.
.TP
\fBmaxbuf=\fP
buffersize in bytes, to read a block.
.TP 20
\fBswap=\fP
Swap bytes after low level read? This only applies to the header, not to
the actual data. Programmers must still do this themselves. If using a
specific block to display, the data bytes are swapped based on the
data type given by \fBtype=\fP.
