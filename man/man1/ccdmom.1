.SH NAME
ccdmom \- moment along an axis of an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBccdmom\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBccdmom\fP takes special moments along an axis of an image/cube.
.PP
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input image file. No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output image file. No default.
.TP
\fBaxis=\fP
Axis to take moment along (1=x 2=y 3=z)
[Default: \fB1\fP]
.TP
\fBmom=\fP
Moment to take [-1,0,1,2,3..]    
Compute either the sum (0), mean (1), dispersion (2), or peak location (3). Negative
numbers also have a special meaning. -1 computes the average intensity along the axis.
[Default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBkeep=t|f\P
Boolean value if to keep the moment axis. If you keep the axis (instead
of compressing it), the values are replaced with the computed moment.
This can be useful if you want to subtract an cube/image with the
mean value along a certain axis. 
[Default: \fBf\fP].
.SH BUGS
Cannot compute straight moments, e.g. the 2nd moment along an axis, the 
program only computes user friendly numbers (sum, mean, dispersion)
