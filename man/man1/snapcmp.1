.SH NAME
snapcmp \- compare two N-body snapshots
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnapcmp in1=\fPsnap_file \fBin2=\fPsnap_file [parameter=value] .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsnapcmp\fP is a flexible tool for comparing two N-body snapshots on
a particle by particle basis.  An arbitrary ``observable'' defined in
terms of the basic components of a \fIbody\fP(3NEMO) may be specified
for the comparison.  Particles are compared by differencing their
observables, or by computing the observable applied to a differenced
particle.  These options cover most of the common methods of comparing
N-body snapshots.  The default settings compute the magnitude of the
configuration-space displacements between each pair of particles.  
.PP
The program simply outputs six numbers: time of the first snapshot,
are the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and 
maximum of the measured differences.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized.
.TP 24
\fBin1=\fP\fIsnap_file1\fP
.TP
\fBin2=\fP\fIsnap_file2\fP
Input data is read from \fIsnap_file1\fP and \fIsnap_file2\fP, which
must be in \fIsnapshot\fP(5NEMO) format.  Default: none.
.TP
\fBtime1=\fP\fItime_range1\fP
.TP
\fBtime2=\fP\fItime_range2\fP
Data with time values within \fItime_range1\fP and \fItime_range2\fP
will be read from \fIsnap_file1\fP and \fIsnap_file2\fP, respectively.
[Default: \fBall\fP].
.TP
\fBobs=\fP\fIobs_expression\fP
\fIobs_expression\fP is the observable used to compare the particles.
See \fIbodytrans\fP(1NEMO) for the form of \fIobs_expression\fP.
Default: \fBr\fP, which compares the positions of particles.
.TP
\fBdiffpart=\fP\fIflag\fP
If \fIflag\fP is true, particles are compared by subtracting the
components of one from the components of the other, and evaluating the
observable \fBobs\fP on this ``differenced particle''. Otherwise,
\fBobs\fP is evaluated for each particle, and the results are
differenced.  Default: \fBtrue\fP.
.TP
\fBrelative\fP\fI=flag\fP
If \fIflag\fP is true, the differenced observable is divided by the
value of \fBobs\fP computed from the particle in \fIsnap_file1\fP.
Otherwise, the differenced observable is used.  Default: \fBfalse\fP.
