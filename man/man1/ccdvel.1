.TH CCDVEL 1NEMO "14 October 1999"
.SH NAME
ccdvel \- create a velocity field; grid or retrace
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBccdvel out=\fPvelfie [parameters=values ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIccdvel\fP creates a velocity field for a disk with material
in circular orbits. The user supplies the
program with a rotation curve with number of radii and associated 
rotation velocities. The position
angle and inclination of each 'ring' can also be varied to simulate a 
galactic warp. 
.PP
Two gridding methods exist: 
.PP
\fIretracing:\fP the GIPSY 
method retraces each pixel in the sky plane to its (smallest) 
radius in the (warped) galactic disk: it's ring parameters 
(velocity, position angle, and inclination) are then
linearly \fIinterpolated\fP from the input arrays, and that point is
appropriately projected into that pixel (\fIhmmm, it might then
wind up in the next pixel\fP)
.PP
\fIgridding:\fP the NEMO method places particles in rings, as prescribed
by the input values, and computes a properly intensity weighted
(number of particles in this case) mean velocity per pixel. This
may however results in a 'meaningless' mean velocity in areas where
rings are projected on top of each other.
\fINote:\fP This mode, originally the only one, 
merely served as a shortcut between 
the various N-body creators, followed by subsequent gridding with 
\fIsnapgrid\fP.
.PP
The center coordinates and systemic velocity are currently fixed for
all rings.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized:
.TP 25
\fBout\fP=\fIimage_out\fP
Output velocity field map, will be in \fIimage(5NEMO)\fP format.
No default.
.TP
\fBradii\fP=\fIr1,r2,...\fP
Radii (arcsec). Note they must be sorted by increasing radius.
The default is taken from the \fIrotcur_table\fP table below, or
from this keyword.
.TP
\fBvrot\fP=\fIv1,v2,...\fP
Array of rotation velocities, one for each radius,
If less than the number of radii is
given, the trailing ones are filled with the last supplied value.
The default values from the \fIrotcur_table\fP table below can be also 
be overridden with this keyword.
.TP
\fBinc\fP=\fIi1,i2,...\fP
Array of inclinations (degrees), one for each radius.
The default values from the \fIrotcur_table\fP table below can be also 
be overridden with this keyword.
.TP
\fBpa\fP=\fIp1,p2,...\fP
Array of  position angles (degrees), one for each radius.
The default values from the \fIrotcur_table\fP table below can be also 
be overridden with this keyword.
.TP
\fBsize\fP=\fInx,ny\fP
Size of map, up to two numbers.
If one number supplied, the map will be
square. [Default: \fB128\fP].
.TP
\fBcell\fP=\fIdx,dy\fP
Cell size, up to two numbers.
If one number supplied, the cells will be
square. [Default: \fB1\fP].
.TP
\fBcenter\fP=\fIx0,y0\fP
Rotation center (grids with lower left corner being 0,0). 
Default: center of map if \fIrotcur_table\fP is not used, else
the \fIcenter_ring\fP entry from the \fIrotcur_table\fP. 
.TP
\fBvsys\fP=\fIvsys\fP
Systemic velocity. 
Default: \fB0\fP if \fIrotcur_table\fP is not used, else
the \fIcenter_ring\fP entry from the \fIrotcur_table\fP.
.TP
\fBrotcurfit=\fP\fIrotcur_table\fP
All ring parameters can also be read from this table, 
that is normally output by \fIrotcur(1NEMO)\fP's \fBtab=\fP keyword.
That table needs to be commented with \fItabcomment(1NEMO)\fP.
.TP
\fBfixring=\fP\fIcenter_ring\fP
Ring number (1..Nring), from the \fIrotcur_table\fP, of which 
the center (\fBvsys, center\fP) is used.
If \fB0\fP is used, they must have been given by the appropriate
keywords. If a large number is given, the last table entry
is used. 
.TP
\fBnoise=\fP\fIv_sigma\fP
Dispersion of the gaussian noise added to the map. Default: 0
.TP
\fBseed=\fP\fIinitial_seed\fP
Initial seed used by the random number generator. If 0 is used,
the time of the day is used instead. Default: 0
.TP
\fBheadline=\fP\fIcomments\fP
Random verbiage added to the output image [Default: none].
.SH EXAMPLE
A velocity field in a file \fImap1\fP is fitted with \fIrotcur\fP, 
starting at the outskirts of the galaxy, 100", and working on inwards
to 10", the table is commented to feed it into \fIccdvel\fP
(note the numeric sort) and compute a model velocity field, after which
that is subtracted from the observations 
(only in points were both model and observations
are not undefined, i.e. 0.0):

.nf

.SH ROTCURFIT
The table \fBrotcurfit\fP assumes the
radius, systemic velocity, rotation velocity, 
position angle, inclination, x center and y center 
are in columns 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 resp.

.SH BUGS
The output map is patched with the undefined value 0.0 whereever
no information is requested for these pixels.
.PP
The \fIgridding\fP method is currently not available. The \fPretracing\fP
method will be used.
