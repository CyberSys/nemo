.TH ROTCUR 1NEMO "13 March 2001"
.SH NAME
rotcur \- fit kinematic parameters from velocity field
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrotcur in=\fPvelfie [parameters=values ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIrotcur\fP derives the kinematical parameters from the observed
velocity field by fitting a tilted-rings model to the velocity field.  It
does a non-linear least-squares-fitting to the function:
.PP
.cs 1 20
.ss 20
.nf
         v(x,y) = VSYS + VROT * cos(theta) * sin(INC)

                      - (x-XPOS) * sin(PA) -/+ (y-YPOS) * cos(PA) ?
where:   cos(theta) = -----------------------------------------
                                       r

                      - (x-XPOS) * cos(PA) - (y-YPOS) * sin(PA)
and:     sin(theta) = -----------------------------------------
                                   r * cos(INC)


.cs 1
.fi
where the radius \fIr\fP is measured in the plane of the galaxy:
.cs 1 20
.ss 20
.nf

         r = sqrt( (x-XPOS)**2 + (y-YPOS)**2/cos(INC)**2 )

.cs 1
.fi
.PP
In the above formula
\fIv(x,y)\fP denotes the radial velocity at rectangular sky
coordinates \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP, \fIVSYS\fP the systemic 
velocity, \fIVROT\fP the rotational
velocity, \fIINC\fP the inclination angle and \fItheta\fP the 
azimuthal distance
from the major axis in the plane of the galaxy.  
In itself, \fItheta\fP is a function of
the inclination (\fIINC\fP) and the 
position angle (\fIPA\fP) of the major axis.
\fIXPOS\fP and \fIYPOS\fP denote the position of the rotation center
in pixels w.r.t. 0,0 being the lower left corner of the map.  \fIrotcur\fP
can fit for each ring the 6 parameters
\fIVSYS\fP, \fIVROT\fP, \fIINC\fP, \fIPA\fP, \fIXPOS\fP
and \fIYPOS\fP, though any combination of them can be fixed
(see \fBfixed=\fP).
The position angle \fIPA\fP of the major axis is defined as the
angle, taken in anti-clockwise direction between the north direction on
the ``sky'' and the major axis of the receding half (positive 
radial velocity) of the galaxy. 
.PP
Values equal the undefined value (currently 0.0) are ignored in the
fit. See \fIccdmath(1NEMO)\fP or \fIfitsccd(1NEMO)\fP on how to
create a velocity field with such undefined values.
.PP
By setting the keyword \fBfitmode=\fP appropriately, \fIrotcur\fP can
also be used to fit a model of pure expansional velocities:
.cs 1 20
.ss 20
.nf

         v(x,y) = VSYS + VROT * sin(theta) * sin(INC)

.cs 1
.fi
use \fBfitmode=sin,1\fP in this case. \fIcurrently XPOS and YPOS \fBmust\fP
be held fixed in this case\fP.
.PP
For a detailed discussion of this method see K. Begeman,
\fIAstr. & Astrophys. \fP \fB223\fP, 47. (1989) and references
therein.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized:
.TP 25
\fBin\fP=\fIimage_vel\fP
Input velocity field map, must be in \fIimage(5NEMO)\fP format.
No default.
.TP
\fBradii\fP=\fIr0,r1,r2,...rN\fP
Inner and outer radii for \fIN\fP touching rings (in arcsec).
Remember that the number of radii is hence one more
than the number of rings. The \fBunits=\fP keyword can be used to
scale your physical units in the header to ``human readable'' units
(arcsec). Radii must be either all increasing or decreasing.
No default.
.TP
\fBvrot\fP=\fIv1,v2,...vN\fP
Array of rotation (or expansion) velocities, one for each ring. 
If less than the number of rings is
given, the trailing ones are filled with the last supplied value.
.TP
\fBpa\fP=\fIp1,p2,...pN\fP
Array of position angles (degrees), one for each ring.
See also \fBvrot=\fP.
.TP
\fBinc\fP=\fIi1,i2,...iN\fP
Array of inclinations (degrees), one for each ring.
See also \fBvrot=\fP.
.TP
\fBvsys\fP=\fIv0\fP
Systemic velocity. Only one number applies.
.TP
\fBcenter\fP=\fIx0,y0\fP
Rotation center (grid units w.r.t. lower left corner being
0,0). Two numbers are required.
Default: center of map.
.TP
\fBfrang\fP=
free angle around minor axis (degrees) from which data is not
taken into the fit (thus the total cone size of ignored data around
the minor axis is 2*\fBfrang\fP)
[Default: \fB20.0\fP].
.TP
\fBside\fP=
Choose the side of the galaxy to fit the velocity field to.
Valid options are \fBreceding\fP, \fBapproaching\fP 
or \fBboth\fP side(s). [Default: \fBboth\fP].
.TP
\fBweight\fP=
Choice of weighting function with which points are weighed into
the least squares solution as a function of galactic angle away
from the major axis. Valid options are: \fBuniform\fP, \fBcosine\fP,
and \fBcos-squared\fP.
[Default: \fBcosine\fP].
.TP
\fBfixed\fP=
List of parameters, separated by commas, to be kept fixed during the fit.
Choose any of the
following: \fBvsys, vrot, pa, inc, xpos, ypos\fP, although at least
one parameters should be kept free. [Default: none, i.e. all parameters
free.
.TP
\fBellips\fP=
The names of two parameters for which to calculate an error ellips. 
(see \fBfixed=\fP). For the two parameters it shows the major
and minor axis, position angle of the one sigma deviation ellipse.
[Default: not used]
.TP
\fBbeam\fP=
The beam size (FWHM) for beam correction. One or two numbers required.
Currently these are only used to correct error bars for the number
of independant points per beam. If not given, each point is assumed
independant. [no correction].
.TP
\fBdens\fP=\fIimage_den\fP
Image containing the density. From this local derivatives
\fI(dN/dx)/N\fP and 
\fI(dN/dy)/N\fP are computed numerically, and used for an 
estimate of beam smearing corrections.
[Default: required if a beam is supplied].
.TP
\fBtab\fP=
If specified, this output table is used in \fIappend\fP mode!
This table can be piped through \fItabcomment(1NEMO)\fP and 
fed to \fIccdvel(1NEMO)\fP to create model velocity fields.
[Default: not used].
.TP
\fBresid\fP=
If specified, this output table will contain a listing of X, Y, Velocity
and Residual Velocities in each ring. Each ring will be separated from
the previous one with a simple commented line specifying which ring
it refers to. It is mostly intended for debugging purposes.
[Default: not used].
.TP
\fBtol\fP=
Tolerance for convergence of \fInllsqfit\fP [Default: \fB0.001\fP].
.TP
\fBlab\fP=
Mixing parameter for \fInllsqfit\fP [Default: \fB0.001\fP]
.TP
\fBitmax\fP=
Maximum number of allowed \fInllsqfit\fP iterations [Default: \fB50\fP]
.TP
\fBunits\fP=
Units of input axes. Valid options are
\fBdeg, arcmin, arcsec, rad\fP. A numeric value can also be given,
in which case your image pixel separation from the
image header is multiplied by this
number to get to the ``arcsec'' that will be quoted in
the tables.
[Default: \fBdeg\fP]
.TP
\fBblank=\fP
Value of the blank pixel that needs to be ignored. [Default: \fB0.0\fP].
.TP
\fBinherit=t|f\fP
Logical denoting if the initial conditions for subsequent fitted rings
should be inherited from the previous successfully fitted ring. The fixed
parameters keep of course their fixed value. [Default: \fBt\fP]
.TP
\fBfitmode=\fP\fBcos|sin\fP\fB,1\fP
.TP
\fBnsigma=\fP
Reject outlier points will fall outside nsigma times the dispersion 
away from the mean velocity in a ring. By default, it will not reject any outliers.
.SH AWK
The standard output is normally not very useful; it displays, for each
iteration, the run of parameters plus the number of points and mean
error in the ring. The following \fIawk(1)\fP
scripts may be useful to extract
information per ring:
\fIiter. number, vsys, vrot, pa, icn, xpos, ypos, npoints, sigma_vel\fP.
.nf

BEGIN{count=0;line="";}
{
  if ($1 == "radius"){
    if (count != 0){
      printf("%s  %s\n",rad,line);
      rad=$4;
    }else{
      count=1; 
      rad=$4;
    }
  }else{
    line=$0
  }
}
END{printf("%s  %s\n",rad,line);}

.fi
.SH BUGS
Failures in \fInllsqfit\fP are not handled gracefully, and may
\fIerror\fP out the program. Usage of the \fBerror=\fP system
keyword can be used to bypass such bad rings, use with caution
though and study the output.
.PP
Errorbars quoted in the table are only an estimate since the beam
size is not known. Multiply these numbers by the square root
of the number of pixels per beam to get a more realistic estimate.
.PP
Sign of \fIDx,Dy\fP in the CCD header is ignored, and an astronomical
image is assumed.
