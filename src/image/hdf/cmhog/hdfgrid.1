.TH HDFGRID 1NEMO "12 December 1999"
.SH NAME
hdfgrid \- Regrid a polar HDF SDS to cartesian image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBhdfgrid\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhdfgrid\fP regrids HDF (SDS) output files that are assumed to
be in polar (rad-phi) coordinates. This program was developed 
for the bar-hydro project (Piner, Stone & Teuben, ApJ - nov 1995)
using a version of \fBcmhog\fP.
.PP
The (2D) four-point interpolation that is used in regridding is
based on the one in \fIcmhog/movie.src\fP, but includes correct
interpolations for points near the Y axis that need contributions
from the phantom "mirror" points (recall that the files are
assumed to contain X>0 information only, the X<0 plane is assumed
from point symmetry around the origin).
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP\fIhdf_sds\fP
Input file (HDF SD). No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP\fIimage\fP
Output file, in \fIimage(5NEMO)\fP format.
.TP
\fBselect=\fP\fIframe_no\fP
Select which SDS from the file (1=first). 
[Default: \fB1\fP].
.TP
\fBnx=\fP\fIX_pixels\fP
Number of pixels in X.
[Default: \fB256\fP]
.TP
\fBny=\fP\fIY_pixels\fP
Number of pixels in Y   
[Default: \fB256\fP].
.TP
\fBxrange=\fP\fIxmin:xmax\fP
Range in X     
[Default: \fB-16:16\fP].
.TP
\fByrange=\fP\fIymin:ymax\fP
Range in Y     
[Default: \fB-16:16\fP].
.TP
\fBzvar=\fP\fIgrid_var\fP
Gridding variable. Normally left alone, unless certain allowed mathematical
expressions on the direct griddable variables (as defined by \fBselect=\fP)
need to be overriden. Allowed are vr (select=1), vt (select=2),
den (select=3), vx, vy. Default: not used, select= is used.
.TP
\fBsymmetry=odd|even\fP
Override symmetry properties of the variable to be gridded. This option is
not used yet.
.TP
\fBit0=\fP
Shifts the values in theta by \fBfBit0\fP pixels. This is equivalent 
by rotating the image counterclockwise by that many pixels. 
Default: 0
.SH EXAMPLES
Often used in scripts, here is a snippet from a script that regrids an
HDF file into TIFF for movie recording, but applying a non-linear scaling
to the data. 
.nf

  hdfgrid hdf001 - select=3 nx=256 ny=256 xrange=-8:8 yrange=-8:8 |\\
     ccdmath - - "log(%1)" |\\
     ccdmath - - "ifeq(%1,0.0,$dmin,%1)" |\\
     ccdfits - tmp$$
  fitstiff tmp$$ movie1.$i.tiff datamin=-1 datamax=2 lut=ds

.fi
Several interesting peculiarities are to be noted: (1) ccdmath is called
twice, because of a bug in combining the two; \fBifeq(%1,0.0,$dmin,log(%1))\fP
could not be used. (2) fitstiff cannot read from a pipe,  hence the extra
annoying disk file \fBtmp$$\fP. (3) Lookup RGB color tables are in 
\fB$NEMODAT/lut\fP.
