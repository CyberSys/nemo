.TH RUNCMHOG 1NEMO "19 February 1997"
.SH NAME
runcmhog \- preprocess a CMHOG namelist and run program in a new directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBruncmhog\fP \fI[-options]\fP \fIrun_directory\fP \fI[[namelist:][key=val]]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBruncmhog\fP is a preprocessor to run (a series of) CMHOG programs.
It expects the 'cmhogin' input file to be present in the local
directory, uses that, but any variables can be overridden via
the commandline. 
The first argument must be a (non-existent) directory name, in
which a new 'cmhogin' file will be written, and cmhog will be 
run. The 'cmhog' program is allowed to be in the unix PATH
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are recognized, they must appear before
the \fIrun_directory\fP name
.TP 20
\fB-n\fP \fInamelist\fP
Optional name of the \fInamelist\fP file. Default: \fBcmhogin\fP.
.TP
\fB-e\fP \fIexecutable\fP
Optional name of the executable name. Default: \fBcmhog\fP.
.SH CAVEAT
There is no provision for the same key in multiple namelists yet
The solution would be to precede the keyword with "name/"
.PP
Cannot add new keywords, they must already have an entry in the
\fIcmhogin\fP
template
.SH EXAMPLE
Here is a shell script running a series of models from a template \fIcmhogin\fP
in the current directory.
